## Eduard Library

Eduard Library is a cryptographic software artifact implemented in C#, designed to optimize multi-precision 
integer arithmetic with direct applicability to elliptic curve cryptography (<b>ECC</b>). Its primary objective is to 
provide a performant and mathematically rigorous foundation for the implementation of elliptic curveâ€“based 
protocols, encryption systems, and digital signature schemes.<br/>

This work originates from an independent research initiative in Number Theory, Algebraic Geometry, and Elliptic 
Curve Cryptography, and is intended to serve as a reliable reference for experimental and theoretical investigations 
into computational aspects of modern cryptography.<br/>
